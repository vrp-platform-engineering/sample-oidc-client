## Quick Test Flow

1. **Start the client application** (see README.md for setup)

2. **Navigate to the login page** and click "Login"

3. **You will be redirected to the IDP** at `https://uat-ext-idp.valleyfirst.com`

4. **Enter the test credentials above**

5. **Grant consent** (only if the client is configured with `ConsentType: "explicit"` or `"systematic"`; skipped if `"implicit"`)

6. **You will be redirected back** to the client with tokens

## Client Configuration for Testing

Update `appsettings.json` with:

```json
{
  "OIDC": {
    "Authority": "https://uat-ext-idp.valleyfirst.com/",
    "ClientId": "<your-client-id>",
    "ClientSecret": "<your-client-secret>",
    "RedirectUri": "https://localhost:9000/signin-oidc",
    "PostLogoutRedirectUri": "https://localhost:9000/signout-callback-oidc",
    "Scopes": "openid profile email offline_access member_id"
  }
}
```

> **Note:** Request your Client ID and Secret from VeriPark if you don't have them.

## Known Limitations

| Limitation | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Self-signed certificates** | This test environment uses self-signed certificates generated by Azure Key Vault. You may need to set `"SkipCertificateValidation": true` in your client configuration. Production environments will use proper CA-signed certificates. |

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| certificate errors | Set `"SkipCertificateValidation": true` in config (dev only) |
| "Invalid redirect_uri" | Ensure your callback URL is registered with VeriPark |
| Login page not loading | Verify the IDP URL is accessible from your network |
| No consent screen | See "Known Limitations" above — consent behavior depends on `ConsentType` config |
